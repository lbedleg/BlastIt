# Game Setup Requirements (Option A)

# 1) Check Node.js version
node -v
# If the version is >= 18, you're good to go.
# If the version is < 18, install and use the latest LTS with nvm:

# 2) Install/Use Node LTS (only if Node < 18)
# (If you don't have nvm yet, install from https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
nvm install --lts        # or: nvm install 20
nvm use --lts
node -v                  # confirm it's 18+ (ideally 20.x)
